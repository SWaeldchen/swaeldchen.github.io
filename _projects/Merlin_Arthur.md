The idea is to expand Merlin-Arthur Classification setup in the following ways:


1. Larger Datasets
  * Streetview Housenumbers, where we can compare with bounding boxes
  * Medicine Data, where Explainability Methods had been challenged in the past
  *

2. Text-based Explanations
  * Have agents explain their rationale via text
  * Train Arthur as LLM to play a simple game (e.g. Connect Four) in some text based fashion
  * Merlin and Morgana are implemented as LLMs reasoners explaining their reasoning for the next move and Arhtur has to decide with which move he goes.
