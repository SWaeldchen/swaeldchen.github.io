**What is this about?**

We write a Musical about the dangers of AI with 5 roles. All parts are written by humans for humans. After all, this might really be the last musical where this is done. **A historic moment!**

When this was conceived, the main motivation was to alert the public about the dangers of runaway AI progress. Since these are now more ubiquitous in the news cycle, the main idea is to present the case for government regulation of AI progress in the form of musical story telling.


**Current Progress:**

- 3/14 songs are written
- Character design is 90% complete
- Overall 2-act plot structure is done
- Dialogues still need to be written in detail
- Instrumentalisation to be settled (probably piano, guitar, base, drums, violin, one brass instrument)

**I want to contribute:**

We are still looking for help if:
- You play an instrument and can write accompanyment when given the melody and harmonies?
- You are a singer and actor that would love to be involved in the first staging?
- You have experience with directing/lighting/makeup/staging/props?
