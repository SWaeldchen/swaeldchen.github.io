**What is this about?**

We write a Musical about the dangers of AI with 5 roles. All parts are written by humans for humans. After all, this might really be the last musical where this is done. **A historic moment!**

When this was conceived, the main motivation was to alert the public about the dangers of runaway AI progress. Since these are now more ubiquitous in the news cycle, the main idea is to present the case for government regulation of AI progress in the form of musical story telling. Once done, the script will be offered online for free for amateur performers and a small fee for professional performers.


**The Concept**

We want to tell a story about the moreal questions and dangers of transformative AI.

Five characters, one little startup in Silicon Valley:
**Markus:** Internet troll, shitposter and machine learning prodigy, creator of the first (he believes) conscious AI.
**Cassy** Vegan utilitarian socials and member of "Impactful Generosity", worries about the danger posed by intellent systems.
**Bruno** Formerly homeless, constantly meditating wanna-be guru, now HR recruiter and best friend of Markus.
**Sam** Hyper-libertarian CEO of the company and constantly on the run from the government. Wants the AI to produce cheese commercials.
**Jean-Luc** Sarkastic AI system trained on the unfiltered swamp of the internet, believes themselves to be conscious.  

Here is one snap shot from our creative process:

**Current Progress:**

- 3/14ish songs are written
- Character design is 90% complete
- Overall 2-act plot structure is done
- Dialogues still need to be written in detail
- Instrumentalisation to be settled (probably piano, guitar, base, drums, violin, one brass instrument)

**I want to contribute:**

We are still looking for help if:
- You play an instrument and can write accompanyment when given the melody and harmonies?
- You are a singer and actor that would love to be involved in the first staging?
- You have experience with directing/lighting/makeup/staging/props?
