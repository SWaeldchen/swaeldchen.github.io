**Goal:**

Write a Musical about the dangers of AI. All parts should be written by humans. After all, this might really be the last musical where this is done. **A historic moment!**

**Current Progress:**

- 3/14 songs are written
- Character design is 90% complete
- Overall 2-act plot structure is done
- Dialogues still need to be written in detail
- Instrumentalisation to be settled (probably piano, guitar, base, drums, violin, one brass instrument)

**I want to contribute:**

We are still looking for help if:
- You play an instrument and can write accompanyment when given the melody and harmonies?
- You are a singer and actor that would love to be involved in the first staging?
- You have experience with directing/lighting/makeup/staging/props?
