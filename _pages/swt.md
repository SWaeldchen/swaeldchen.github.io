The core skills that make me an employee of exceptional ability are:
- high problem-solving ability,
- quick adaption to new knowledge,
- strong ownership of projects/high agency,
- creative, out-of-the box thinking,
- extroverted, empathic personality, good communicator.
Here are some example projects to illustrate these skills:
Master in Quantum Information Theory: My master project was in quantum information theory, and I proved a convergence theorem for a class of tensor network renormalisation schemes.I was especially proud that it happened after my Professor and my Postdoc supervisor had given up on the problem. Solving it involved coming up with a new eigenvector perturbation bound for quantum channels via Perron-Frobenius theory, a field where I had no prior experience in. When I felt like some technique could work, but I lacked the necessary in-depth knowledge, I would contact experts in the field, schedule a meeting with them and asked them questions until I was able to understand the topic well enough to make use of it.
Reverse-engineered a car security protocol (in 4 months): In 2017, I worked in a car sharing company that developed an interface to remotely open and start the car. My task was to reverse engineer a common (VW) cryptographic scheme that the RFID chip of the car key used. I was able to extract the secret key, which allowed us to emulate the protocol on our own hardware for a wide range of cars in circulation. This involved:
- soldering my own antennas to listen in on the car-key communication,
- consulting online hacker forums,
- writing the C code to emulate a car RFID chip with a Proxmark3,
- finding a security hole that allowed me to probabilistically invert a cryptographic function,
- acquiring access to an older car with a weaker key length,
- turning a large truth table into a small Boolean function in algebraic normal form.
I was a fresh beginner in all of these tasks and was able to break the encryption within a 4 months time frame. I worked completely independently, but had help with the soldering equipment.
Musical translations: My biggest hobby is musical theatre, and I like translating musical numbers into German. This is a surprisingly intricate and complex optimisation task, as you have to fit meaning, rhythm, rhyming and vocalisation together, which often requires out-of-the-box thinking to make the song sound genuine and not just translated. One of the musicals I translated, I also performed with friends. I am also currently writing my own musical about a startup that creates a rogue AI, more infos on my website.
Logical Puzzles: I love solving and designing and logical puzzles. I participated in multiple puzzle hunts (2x Amazon Internal Puzzle hunt, was invited by friends who work there, 1x MUMS puzzle hunt, countless times informal ones with friends). Four time in the last 10 years, I designed or co-designed puzzle hunts or murder mystery games that I then played with my friends or colleagues.
