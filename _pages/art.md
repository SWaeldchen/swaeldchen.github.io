## Unfinished Scripts:

<a style="font-weight:bold" href="/art/krampus">Saint Niklas and the Krampus:</a>
This is the plot for a Christmas theater play based on Alpine folklore, especially the mythical deamon creature called Krampus, and the idea of responsibility and extrinsic vs intirinsic morality.

**Lifesaver:** A film script about three friends who discover a strange device that let's them save and reload a snapshot of their life just as in a video game. Seeming fun and increadibly useful at first, they each start to succumb to a dark path chartered by their respective psychology.
