This post is part 4 of my series on <a href="/blog/2023/FI_start/">Interactive Classification</a>

*TL;DR:
We explain the computational complexity of interpreting neural network classifier. We will see why interpreting them is a hard task even if done only approximately

1. Hardness of Probabilistic Prime Implicants
1. Hardness of Approximation
1. Further Relaxation
1. Practical Approach

More will follow here, when I have the time!
