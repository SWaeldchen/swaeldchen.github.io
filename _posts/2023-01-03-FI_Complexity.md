This post is part 2 of my series on <a href="/blog/2023/FI_start/">Formal Interpretability</a>

*TL;DR:
We explain the computational complexity of interpreting neural network classifier. We will see why interpreting them is a hard task even if done only approximately

1. Hardness of Probabilistic Prime Implicants
1. Hardness of Approximation
1. Further Relaxation
1. Practical Approach
